If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Platform.

1\. User Agreements  
1.1 Binding Agreement: These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you (the “User” or “you”), as an authorized representative of a business, and FinCl AI Ltd for your use of the Platform. The Platform is intended solely for business-to-business (B2B) use by SMBs and is not available for consumers, retail investors, or individuals under 18 years of age.  
1.2 Eligibility: To use the Platform, you must:

1.3 Account Setup and Security:  
•  To access the Platform, you must create an account or log in using a supported third-party service (e.g., Google, Apple, LinkedIn). You agree to provide accurate and complete business information (e.g., company name, contact details) during registration and to keep this information updated.

1.4 Beta Period and Subscription:  
•  New users receive a one-month free beta period upon signup, during which full Platform functionality is available without charge. No payment information is required during the beta period.

•  You may cancel during the beta period without charge. Failure to cancel before the beta period ends will result in automatic enrollment in the paid subscription.  
1.5 Global Availability: The Platform is available globally, subject to compliance with local laws. Users in the United Kingdom, European Economic Area (EEA), or Switzerland are subject to additional terms ensuring compliance with the UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and EU regulations (see Section 7). Users outside these regions are responsible for ensuring their use of the Platform complies with applicable local laws, including data protection and business regulations.  
1.6 Third-Party Integrations: The Platform integrates with third-party tools (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero, or other business management software) to facilitate data import and analysis. By using these integrations, you authorize FinCl AI to access and process data from these tools as necessary for Platform functionality, subject to our Privacy Policy and the third-party’s terms and privacy policies. You represent that you have the right to share such data with FinCl AI.

2.2 Prohibited Actions: You may not:  
•  Reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, or attempt to extract source code from the Platform or its integrations.

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights, consents, and legal authority to upload and share such data with FinCl AI and that such data complies with applicable laws.

3\. Privacy and Data Security  
3.1 Privacy Policy: Our Privacy Policy (https://fincl.ai/legal/privacy-policy) governs the collection, use, processing, and sharing of your data, including sensitive business data provided via uploads or third-party integrations. It complies with the UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and applicable global data protection laws and is incorporated by reference but not part of these Terms.  
3.2 Sensitive Data: You may upload or provide via integrations sensitive data, such as financial records, sales data, or customer information, for analysis. FinCl AI employs industry-standard security measures, including AES-256 encryption, secure cloud storage, and access controls, to protect your data. However, no system is immune to security breaches, and you must promptly notify FinCl AI at support@fincl.ai of any suspected breach or unauthorized access.  
3.3 Data Processing and Transfers:  
•  Data is primarily processed in the UK or EEA. For global users, data transfers comply with applicable laws, such as UK GDPR requirements or Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers.  
•  You may opt out of using your data for AI model training or request data deletion by contacting support@fincl.ai. Deletion requests are processed within 30 days, subject to legal obligations (e.g., tax or audit requirements).  
•  FinCl AI acts as an independent data controller for data you provide.  
3.4 Data Retention: Data you upload or provide via integrations is retained for 6 months after your subscription ends or upon your deletion request, unless longer retention is required by law (e.g., for tax, audit, or legal compliance purposes). After the retention period, data is securely deleted or anonymized.  
3.5 Third-Party Data: Data provided via third-party integrations (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero) is subject to the respective third-party’s terms and privacy policies. FinCl AI is not liable for the data handling practices of third-party providers but will ensure secure data transfers in accordance with our Privacy Policy.  
3.6 Anonymized Data: When you interact with the Platform without logging in, interactions are anonymous. FinCl AI may use aggregated, de-identified data to improve the Platform’s algorithms or generate benchmarking insights for SMBs, provided such data does not identify your business.  
3.7 ICO Registration: FinCl AI is registered with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). For additional information, see our FAQs at https://fincl.ai/legal/faq.

4\. Limitations and Disclaimers  
4.1 “AS IS” Service: The Platform is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of accuracy, completeness, reliability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. FinCl AI does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free access to the Platform.  
4.2 Output Limitations:  
•  The Platform generates dashboards, analyses, and recommendations based on the data you provide (via uploads or third-party integrations) and AI algorithms. Outputs may contain errors, inaccuracies, or “hallucinations” due to incomplete or inaccurate data, market volatility, or algorithmic limitations.  
•  Outputs are for informational purposes only and are not a substitute for professional financial, tax, legal, or business advice. The Platform is not a regulated financial service and does not provide investment advice or recommendations under FCA or similar regulations.  
•  You are responsible for critically evaluating all outputs and verifying them with qualified professionals before using them for critical decisions (e.g., budgeting, investments, or strategic planning). FinCl AI is not liable for decisions made based on Platform outputs or for external factors (e.g., market changes, third-party data errors) affecting output accuracy.

4.4 Liability Cap: To the fullest extent permitted by law, FinCl AI’s total liability for any claims arising from your use of the Platform is limited to the amount paid for your subscription in the preceding 12 months (or £100, whichever is greater). FinCl AI is not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation aligns with UK law, covering foreseeable damages but excluding non-excludable liabilities (e.g., fraud, death, or personal injury caused by negligence).  
4.5 Third-Party Liability: FinCl AI is not liable for errors, breaches, or losses caused by third-party tools or their data, including inaccuracies in data provided via integrations. You are responsible for ensuring that third-party integrations comply with your legal obligations.
