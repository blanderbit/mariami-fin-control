1\. Information We Collect  
We collect information to provide, improve, and personalize the Platform’s services for SMBs. The types of information depend on how you interact with the Platform (e.g., via account creation, data uploads, or third-party integrations).  
1.1 Information You Provide Directly:

•  Support Communications: Information you provide when contacting us (e.g., via support@fincl.ai), such as inquiries, feedback, or attachments.  
•  Billing Information: For subscription payments, we collect limited billing details (e.g., company name, billing address) via third-party payment processors. We do not directly collect or store payment information such as credit card details.  
1.2 Information Collected Automatically:

•  Cookies and Tracking Technologies: We use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons) to enhance user experience, analyze usage, and deliver personalized features. Essential cookies are required for Platform functionality, while optional cookies (e.g., for analytics or marketing) can be managed via our cookie consent tool or your browser settings.  
1.3 Information from Third Parties:  
•  We receive data from third-party integration providers (e.g., accounting software) when you authorize access, such as financial or operational data necessary for analysis.

Despite these measures, no system is completely secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and promptly reporting any suspected breaches to support@fincl.ai. We are not responsible for data security breaches caused by third-party integration providers or your failure to secure your account.

After this period, data is securely deleted or anonymized.  
•  Model Training Opt-Out: We may use your uploaded or integrated data to train and improve our AI models. You can opt out of this use by contacting support@fincl.ai. Opting out does not affect your ability to use the Platform.
